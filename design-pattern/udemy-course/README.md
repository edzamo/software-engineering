# Design Patterns in Java

This project is a hands-on exploration of common software design patterns, implemented in Java 21 with Gradle.

## What Are Design Patterns?

In software engineering, a **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Design patterns are formalized best practices that a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. They can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

This repository will cover various patterns, providing clear examples and explanations for each one.
