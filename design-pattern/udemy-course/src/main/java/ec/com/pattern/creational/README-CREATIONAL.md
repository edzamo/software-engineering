## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are all about class instantiation. These patterns can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

In simple terms, they deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

This document covers the following creational patterns:
1.  **Factory Method**
2.  **Abstract Factory**

---

### 1. Factory Method

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### How to Use It

This pattern is used when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create. The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the `new` operator) with calls to a special *factory* method.

In the provided example (`ec.com.pattern.creational.factorymethod.payment`), we have a simple implementation of a factory for creating different types of payments.

1.  **Product Interface (`Payment`):** An interface that defines the operations of the objects the factory will create. In this case, it's the `doPayment()` method.
2.  **Concrete Products (`CardPayment`, `GooglePayment`, `PaypalPayment`):** These are the concrete classes that implement the `Payment` interface.
3.  **Factory (`PaymentFactory`):** This class contains a static method `buildPayment()` that, based on a `TypePayment` enum, returns a concrete instance of a `Payment`. The client code calls this method to get a payment object without having to know the specific implementation details.

### Class Diagram (Payment Example)

Here is the UML class diagram for the payment example:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentFactory {
        +buildPayment(TypePayment): Payment
    }

    class TypePayment {
        <<enumeration>>
        CARD
        GOOGLE
        PAYPAL
    }

    class Payment {
        <<interface>>
        +doPayment()
    }

    class CardPayment {
        +doPayment()
    }

    class GooglePayment {
        +doPayment()
    }

    class PaypalPayment {
        +doPayment()
    }

    PaymentFactory ..> Payment : creates
    PaymentFactory ..> TypePayment : uses
    Payment <|.. CardPayment
    Payment <|.. GooglePayment
    Payment <|.. PaypalPayment
```
üîπ Simple explanation with a real-world example

Imagine you work at a bank:
    1. The customer chooses to pay with a card, Google Pay, or PayPal.
    2. The factory (PaymentFactory) receives that information (the TypePayment enum).
    3. The factory creates the appropriate object:
        ‚Ä¢ If it's CARD ‚Üí returns CardPayment.
        ‚Ä¢ If it's GOOGLE ‚Üí returns GooglePayment.
        ‚Ä¢ If it's PAYPAL ‚Üí returns PaypalPayment.
    4. The system calls doPayment() regardless of the payment type, because all classes implement the Payment interface.

‚∏ª

üëâ In summary:
This diagram shows a Factory pattern with polymorphism, where a factory centralizes the creation of different payment types, using an enum to decide which concrete class to instantiate.

### 2. Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.

### How to Use It

This pattern is used when your system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented. You have several families of objects, and you need to ensure that the objects from one family are always used together.

In the provided example (`ec.com.pattern.creational.abstractfactory.furniturestore`), we have an implementation for creating different families (styles) of furniture.

1.  **Product Interfaces (`Chair`, `Sofa`, `CoffeeTable`):** Each interface defines a distinct product.
2.  **Concrete Products (`ModernChair`, `VictorianChair`, etc.):** These are the concrete classes that implement the product interfaces, representing specific styles (Modern, Victorian).
3.  **Generic Abstract Factory (`AbstractFactory<T>`):** A generic interface to create an object of type `T`.
4.  **Concrete Factories (`ChairFurnitureFactory`, `SofaFurnitureFactory`):** These factories implement the generic `AbstractFactory` for a specific product type (e.g., `Chair`). They contain the logic to create different styles of that product.
5.  **Factory Provider (`FactoryProvider`):** A class that provides the client with a specific factory (e.g., `SofaFurnitureFactory`) based on a request. This is a "factory of factories."

The client first gets a specific factory from the `FactoryProvider` and then uses that factory to create a product of a specific style, without knowing the concrete product class.

### Class Diagram (Furniture Store Example)

Here is the UML class diagram for the furniture store example:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class FactoryProvider {
        +getFactory(String choice): AbstractFactory
    }

    class AbstractFactory~T~ {
        <<interface>>
        +create(String type): T
    }

    class ChairFurnitureFactory {
        +create(String type): Chair
    }
    class SofaFurnitureFactory {
        +create(String type): Sofa
    }

    class Chair { <<interface>> }
    class Sofa { <<interface>> }
    class ModernChair { }
    class VictorianChair { }
    class ModernSofa { }
    class VictorianSofa { }

    FactoryProvider ..> AbstractFactory : creates
    FactoryProvider ..> ChairFurnitureFactory : creates
    FactoryProvider ..> SofaFurnitureFactory : creates

    AbstractFactory <|.. ChairFurnitureFactory
    AbstractFactory <|.. SofaFurnitureFactory

    ChairFurnitureFactory ..> ModernChair : creates
    ChairFurnitureFactory ..> VictorianChair : creates
    SofaFurnitureFactory ..> ModernSofa : creates
    SofaFurnitureFactory ..> VictorianSofa : creates

    Chair <|.. ModernChair
    Chair <|.. VictorianChair
    Sofa <|.. ModernSofa
    Sofa <|.. VictorianSofa
```

üîπ **Simple explanation with a real-world example**

Imagine you're furnishing your house and you want everything to match a certain style (e.g., "Modern" or "Victorian").

1.  You decide you need a chair. You go to the "Furniture Store" (`FactoryProvider`).
2.  You ask the store for the "Chair Department" (`ChairFurnitureFactory`).
3.  In the chair department, you ask for a "Modern" style chair. The department gives you a `ModernChair`.
4.  Later, you decide you need a sofa. You go back to the store and ask for the "Sofa Department" (`SofaFurnitureFactory`).
5.  In the sofa department, you ask for a "Modern" style sofa, and you get a `ModernSofa`.

You get matching furniture pieces without having to know the specific manufacturing details. The store and its departments (the factories) handle the creation process for you.

### 3. Builder

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### How It Works

This pattern is especially useful when an object has many configuration parameters, some of which may be optional. Instead of using constructors with a long list of parameters (telescoping constructors), the Builder pattern simplifies object creation.

In the provided example (`ec.com.pattern.creational.builder.Card`), the Builder pattern is implemented to create an immutable `Card` object.

1.  **Product (`Card`):** This is the complex object being built. It has a private constructor that only accepts a `Builder` object. This forces creation to be done exclusively through the builder. Its attributes are `final` to ensure immutability.
2.  **Builder (`Card.Builder`):** This is a static nested class inside `Card`. It contains the same fields as the `Card` class to store the configuration step by step.
3.  **Construction Methods (`set...`):** The `Builder` class has fluent methods (that return `this`) to configure each of the object's attributes. This allows for chaining calls in a readable way (e.g., `new Card.Builder().setCardNumber(...).setCardHolder(...)`).
4.  **`build()` Method:** This method, inside the `Builder` class, invokes the private constructor of `Card`, passing itself as an argument. Finally, it returns the fully constructed and configured `Card` object.

### Class Diagram (Card Example)

Here is the UML class diagram for the `Card` example:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Card {
        -final String cardNumber
        -final String cardHolder
        -final String expirationDate
        -final String cvv
        -Card(Builder builder)
        +toString(): String
    }

    class Builder {
        <<static inner>>
        -String cardNumber
        -String cardHolder
        -String expirationDate
        -String cvv
        +setCardNumber(String): Builder
        +setCardHolder(String): Builder
        +setExpirationDate(String): Builder
        +setCvv(String): Builder
        +build(): Card
    }

    Card "1" *-- "1" Builder : builds
```

üîπ **Explicaci√≥n simple con un ejemplo del mundo real**

Imagina que est√°s pidiendo una pizza personalizada:

1.  Empiezas con una base de pizza vac√≠a (creas una instancia de `Pizza.Builder`).
2.  Le dices al chef qu√© ingredientes agregar, uno por uno: "a√±ade queso", "a√±ade pepperoni", "a√±ade champi√±ones" (llamas a los m√©todos `addCheese()`, `addPepperoni()`, `addMushrooms()`).
3.  Cada vez que a√±ades un ingrediente, el chef sigue trabajando sobre la misma pizza que est√° preparando.
4.  Cuando has terminado de elegir, le dices al chef "¬°Listo!" (llamas al m√©todo `build()`).
5.  El chef mete la pizza al horno y te entrega el producto final, listo para comer.

El `Builder` te permite construir el objeto (`Pizza` o `Card`) de forma flexible y legible, sin necesidad de un constructor con un sinf√≠n de par√°metros.
